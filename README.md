## Tidy Data Assignment

In this project, data obtained using wearable computing is downloaded from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
and a tidy data set 'tidy_data.csv' is created using the R code
in 'run_analysis.R' assuming that the working directory is set to the 
'UCI HAR Dataset' directory obtained by unzipping the downloaded datafile. The
'CodeBook.md' describes the variables used in the 'tidy_data.csv' file.
